<!-- * The length of the array in `questions.js` determines the length of play. 
Fifteen seconds per question is a good estimate, so 5 questions will result in a length of play of 75 seconds.

* Play proceeds as follows:
  * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz."
    Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.
  * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. 
    The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.
  * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score.    
    Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
  * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, 
    the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. (prompt)
    Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.
  * Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
  * Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality. -->
